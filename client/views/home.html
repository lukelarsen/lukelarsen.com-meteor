            <h2 class="title">The Designer</h2>
            <p>I like to play with colors, fonts, and shapes—but I’m not a huge fan of printers, which is why I fell in love with the web. I've had a lot of fun creating web related things over the years. I'm great at working with html and css to make sure my nicely chosen fonts and colors are positioned well on the page. I get a kick out making things look good online! I've done my fair share of javascript (mostly jQuery) to achieve some interaction into my projects … but that’s where my expertise grinds to a halt. I've collaborated with many super-intelligent programmers who breathe life into the static designs I create. I've always been jealous of the crazy things they’re capable of doing. I'm amazed at their ability to build huge databases to store all sorts of information, then extract that data and display it in the html block I gave them. I've had a fair share of personal projects I'd like to see grow into something others can actually use. Unfortunately, I've never had the backend skills to finish any of those projects. This needs to change. I'm going to learn the programming magic I've always admired. Yeah, I know it won't be a cakewalk, and I'm going to wish I could just go back and play with fonts and buttons again, but I'm going to stick with it. Watch and see!</p>

            <h2 class="title">The Site</h2>
            <p>This site will follow my journey to master backend programming skills, highlighting all of my frustrations, successes, stupid mistakes, a-ha moments when something starts to make sense, and resources that I find helpful along the way. If you’re coming here to learn from me you might be disappointed. I won’t be leading by example, but I will point to external sites and individuals whose guidance/tips/advice helped me progress toward my goal. If you see me talking about how I accomplished something and I did it in a way that seems totally ridiculous, please comment and let me know! Again, I’m here to learn and grow as a designer</p>

            <h2 class="title">The Plan</h2>
            <p>I've worked with different backend programmers who used PHP, Ruby, and Python. I recently encountered Node. Coming from a design/frontend background, the language that makes the most sense to me is javascript. Because of this I am going to begin my adventure by playing around with Node js. That might be a mistake in the long run but I'm just going to run with it and see how it goes. Wish me luck. Any help and guidance is greatly appreciated.</p>
